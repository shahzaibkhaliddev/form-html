        Saylani Welfare International Trust has been working for the last 22 years to improve the conditions of the less
        privileged, helpless, and handicapped individuals. The organization is working day and night to make life
        happier, especially for the middle class, lower middle class and even lower class. At time of establishing the
        organization, the founder of Saylani Welfare International Trust and a few of his associates had made a
        commitment to serve the distressed people living in Pakistan and abroad in all stages of life. It is a blessing
        in disguise that today the organization is serving humanity in more than 63 areas of life without any
        discrimination.

        The soul, founder and patron of this organization is Hazrat Allama Maulana Muhammad Bashir Farooqi. He is also a
        well-known spiritual person and Islamic scholar in the Islamic world. It is the result of his efforts that today
        Saylani Welfare International Trust is serving humanity all over the world.

        The organization started out as a rented house and today has at least 630 branches worldwide. The organization
        also has more than 630 Dastarkhwan, where thousands of employees are employed. Today, the organization spends
        more than 7 billion annually on the service and welfare of humanity. Not only this, but more than 63 spheres of
        life from birth to death (including food, health, education, social welfare, clean water, marriage, mass I.T
        training, vocational training, assistance to Syrian and Burmese refugees, pilgrim services, school services
        fees, easy loans, easy employment, hairdressing, medical & diagnostic center, laboratory tests, x-ray,
        ultrasound, ECG, consultant clinic, mobile dining, mobile clinic, mobile air care clinic & operation theater,
        and in case of natural disasters aid) our organization is serving humanity.
